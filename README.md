# VDO.ninja-wrapper
This is **VDO.ninja-wrapper** *(working title)*, and it allows someone to professionally bring in people's remote video feeds into programs like OBS.

It is built for professionals and beginers alike, with the controls any livestream director _wishes_ they could have in more traditional video conferencing software, as well as simple controls anyone can use. Examples of the controls directors have are: remotely adjusting the camera settings of a guest, managing what controls guests have control of, tuning the bitrate and filters of both video and audio, and so much more. For end users, _in the most basic format_, it looks like a video conferencing call, and in the future, directors might be able to add custom branding to make the call feel like the stream they are calling into.

What is the price of this control? FREE! Because this system utilizes VDO.ninja at it's core, which is a peer-to-peer video system, you don't have to pay for us to have any expensive servers. There might be a paid version in the future, however, that will only **add** functionality for storing files, storing presets, authentication security, and/or other things. VDO.ninja-wrapper will **always be Free**.


## VDO.ninja
VDO.Ninja, the core of this system/wrapper, uses peer-to-peer technology to bring remote cameras into OBS or other studio software.

   In most cases, all video data is transferred directly from peer to peer, without needing to go through any video server like more traditional video conferencing apps. This results in high-quality video with super low latency. Because there is no middle-man server for video to run through, **the system is completely free**, and the original system can be used right now at [VDO.ninja](https://vdo.ninja "The core system of VDO.ninja-wrapper").
